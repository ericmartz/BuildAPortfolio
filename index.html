		Notes:
		Tried both col-sm-* and col-md-* for column widths.  I felt the md breakpoint at 970px was too wide.  
		TBH, I don't like the 768 breakpoint, but I wanted to try my hand at Bootstrap so I went with it.
		Thought about customizing the framework for smaller breakpoints, but I figure that is probably a bad practice so I decided against it.

		Wasn't sure about using the picture tag, but decided to go with it.  It looks like it does not have a lot of support yet.
		TODO-maybe: Maybe use PictureFill to handle responsive images? Not sure how much time I want to spend on the initial project.
