		Notes:
		Tried both col-sm-* and col-md-* for column widths.  I felt the md breakpoint at 970px was too wide.  
		TBH, I don't like the 768 breakpoint, but I wanted to try my hand at Bootstrap so I went with it.
		Thought about customizing the framework for smaller breakpoints, but I figure that is probably a bad practice so I decided against it.

		Wasn't sure about using the picture tag, but decided to go with it.  It looks like it does not have a lot of support yet.
		TODO-maybe: Maybe use PictureFill to handle responsive images? Not sure how much time I want to spend on the initial project.

		AFTER INITIAL CODE REVIEW: I feel like I have a lot of comments.  Is this typical?  I don't want to comment too much, but I know other people need to read and understand my thought process.  I'd love to hear a professional web developer's thoughts on this.

		So I wanted to try out PictureFill, but I figured that would work best if I downloaded some pictures.  Did that from Flickr's Public
		Domain images.  There doesn't seem to be a standard for citing work on a website as far as I could find (i.e.: there is no MLA for HTML).
		So I just linked to the photographer's profile on Flickr.  I figured that would work well enough.
